# simple-frontend

## Use Angular CLI

Verify node version > 8.11

```
node -v
```

Verify npm version > 6.0.0

```
npm -v
```
Create an app using the CLI

```
ng new angular7-frontend
```

At this point I made changes to the app, to access the backend services

Now I'm ready to run it:

```
cd angular7-frontend
ng serve
```
